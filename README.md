#Title -TBC
This project will be an educational database aimed at children and teenagers with information about different dinosaur species. It will have information stored for them already and will encourage them to research additional information themselves, providing links to sources. The user will be able to add and store information that they find expanding the database.

#UX
*As a user I want to learn about dinosaurs.
*As a user I want to have an organised place to store what I am learning so that I can look at it again.
*As a user want to be able to update and delete the information I am inputting if there is new information to add   to what I already have.

##Technologies Used
*I will likely use Bootstrap to assist with my page layout- https://getbootstrap.com/
*I will likely use hvr.css to add hover effects to elements on my page-https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/
*I will likely use W3C to validate my HTML and CSS- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
